# This is the back-end of Boolivery.

## Let's see what it can do.

-   Restaurant Registration:

    -   Restaurant owners can use the back-end to register their restaurants. They provide details such as restaurant name, location, and contact information.

    -   Each registered restaurant is associated with a unique identifier.

-   Menu Management:

    -   Once a restaurant is registered, the owner can add its menu items. These items include dishes, beverages, and any other offerings.

    -   Menu items are stored in the database and linked to the respective restaurant.

-   Dish Details:

    -   For each menu item (dish), the back-end stores information such as name, description, price, and availability status (whether itâ€™s currently offered or not).

    -   Owners can easily modify these details as needed.

-   Order Tracking and Statistics:

    -   The back-end keeps track of orders received by each restaurant.

    -   Restaurant owners can view statistics related to order volume over the past year. These stats are broken down by month, allowing owners to identify trends.

-   Earnings Monitoring:

    -   Alongside order statistics, the back-end calculates earnings for each restaurant.

    -   Owners can see how much revenue their restaurant has generated during specific time periods.

In summary, the back-end of Boolivery empowers restaurant owners to manage their menus, track orders, and monitor financial performance.
